# Neural-Machine-Translation
You will build a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to translate human readable dates ("25th of June, 2009") into machine readable dates ("2009-06-25"). You will do this using an attention model, one of the most sophisticated sequence to sequence models.  This notebook was produced together with NVIDIA's Deep Learning Institute.
